# Validation

Extended validation for [validator](http://gopkg.in/validator.v1) in
[Go](http://golang.org).

## Usage

You can use this as a replacement for [validator](http://gopkg.in/validator.v1):

    type User struct {
        Id bson.ObjectId `validate:"required,id"`
        Name    string   `validate:"required,min=5"`
        Email   string   `validate:"required,email"`
        Address Address  `validate:"required,nested"`
    }

    func (u User) Validate() error {
        return validation.Validate(u)
    }

    type Address struct {
        City string `validate:"required,min=5"
    }

    func (a Address) Validate() error {
        return validation.Validate(a)
    }

or just for adding some "missing" constraints:

    func init() {
        // Validates a value or its length when non-zero.
        validator.SetValidationFunc("min", validation.Minimum)
        // Validates a string to be an email address.
        validator.SetValidationFunc("email", validation.Email)
        // Validates a value to be not nil, not zero-value, not empty.
        validator.SetValidationFunc("required", validation.Required)
        // Find more validation funcs in the source code...
    }
